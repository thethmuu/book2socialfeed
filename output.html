                    <p class="text-gray-600">Frequently Made Excuses Welcome to a book that will help you start a million-dollar business in a weekend. We tend to think that we are never ready . . . but you are. The fact is, ordinary people start profitable businesses every single day. You don’t have to be rich, brilliant, or super experienced. But you do have excuses that have held you back in the past. Never again. Here are the ten most common and the exact chapter s where we demolish them: 1. “I don’t have any good ideas.” But you do have problems, and so do your</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">friends and every other person in this world. That’ s all you need to generate million-dol lar business ideas. After you learn the Customer First Approach in chapter 3, you’ll have more business ideas than you’ll know what to do with. 2. “I have too many ideas.” Choose the three you think will be the most fun to work with. In chapter 4, you’ll learn how to use market research and a One-Minu te Business Model to determine which of your three ideas has the most potential. 3. “Starting a business is risky. I’m nervous about quitting my job.” Risky</p>

Leverage the Million Dollar Weekend process (chapter 5) in the early mornings, eveni ngs, and weekends. Once you’ve validated an idea, and you’re pulling in enough to cover your minimum monthly expenses—aka the Freedom Number—then you can quit. I’ve done that twice. 4. “I’ve started a few different businesses. They do okay and then I lose interest.” D’oh. Any one of those businesses could have been what you wanted. Not starting and</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">not finishing both come from a similar set of fears (covered in chapter 1). You will also learn the Law of 100 to help you push past resistance when you feel like quitting. 5. “But how will it scale?” This phrase stops you from getting your first customer . Keep it simple and easy for yourself. Don’ t think about scaling, focus on starting. Then we’ll discuss scaling your business in the chapters in Part 3: Grow It. 6. “I don’t have enough time to create a business.” Look for the processes you can automate, or document parts of the</p>

My productivity system (chapter 9) allows me to run an eight-figure business, a YouTube channel, and a blog, while working out daily , traveling, and so on. If it’s a priority , we can make the time. 7. “I need to read more books, do more research, and be totally prepared before I can really start.” You will never feel 100 percen t ready to start. You just need to start. Don’ t buy another book or watch another video until you’ve worked through THIS process and started your million-dollar business .</p>

I’ve spent so much money and have made zero dollars in profit.” Don’ t spend another dime until you’ve made your first dollar. The Million Dollar W eekend process (chapter 5) requires no up-front spending. 9. “I’m not good at marketing.” Marketing is easy when you have a product people want. Chapter 3 shows you step by step how to find ideas people are excited to give you money for. Then chapters 6, 7, and 8 give you the same marketing methods that I used to help Mint</p>

Your customers don’t want more software, they just want soluti ons (chapter 3). Focus on that. There are affordable ways of validating a biz without any code. Start Here After starting eight million-do llar businesses myself (Kick flip, Gambit, KingSumo, SendFox, Sumo, Tidycal, Monthly1K, AppSumo), I wanted to PROVE I could teach others to do the same.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">that it consists of just a few core steps. I call these three steps the Million Dollar W eekend pr ocess : 1. Find a problem people are having that you can solve. 2. Craft an irresistible solution whose million-dollar -plus potential is backed by simple market research. 3. Spend NO MON EY to quickly validate whether your idea is the real deal (or not) by preselling it before you build it. I knew I was onto something, because early on everyone who followed the process eventually launched a profitable side hustle or business. People like Michael Osborn, who used</p>

Or Daniel Reifenber ger, who turned working at the Apple store into a $250,000-a-year business tutoring people in how to use technology . The problem was, for every Michael, Jennifer , and Daniel, there were a thousand wantrepreneurs in my social media feeds who could never get started.

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Dollar Weekend process works if you just commit to it, why is it SO HARD TO DO for SO MANY PEOPLE? In 2013, I set out to solve that mystery and launched a cours e called “How to Make a $1000-a-Mont h Business.” I started with a group of five beta testers—a programmer , a horse trainer , and three people with ordinary day jobs—all of whom had everything they needed to start their own business. Two weeks after we started, I was shocked to discover the entire group practically made ZERO progres s. To understand what had happened, I</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">got everyone in a room together and did some entrepreneurial group therapy , breaking down what was holding them back. It turns out, it wasn’ t a lack of skill, desire, or intelligence. The whole group was derailed by the same two fears: 1. FEAR OF STARTING. At some point people are told entrepreneurship is a huge risk, and you believed it. You figured more preparation, more planning, and more talking to friends would help you overcome your insecurities. But that inaction only breeds more doubt and fear. In actuality , the best way to learn what we need to</p>

Small EXPER IMENTS, repeated over time, ar e the r ecipe for transformation in business, and life. 2. FEAR OF ASKING. Soon after starting, the fear of rejection emer ges. You have some impressive skills, an amazing product, every advantage in the world, and you’ll never sell a thing if you can’t face another person and ask for what you want. Whether you want them to buy what you’re selling or help in another way, you have to be able to ask in order to get. Once you reframe</p>

I helped that early group and thousands since then to overcom e these blocks, and if you stick with me through this book, I will help you overcome these fears and start your million dollar business. From now on, everything you do in this book, and after, should be viewed as an experiment. This has been a profound shift for people who worry that “starting a business” is this big daunting thing. Experiments are supposed to fail. And should they fail, you just take what you’ve</p>

Take me and any of the super -successful entrepreneurs and side-hustle champions I’ve met over the years. It’s uncanny , but the one commonality nearly all of us share is the crazy number of seemin gly random things we’ve tried to launch— stretching back to our childhood s. Online courses, self-published books, consulting, Airbnbs, affiliate marketing, YouTube channels, a college dating site, and many more . . . And for all of us, almost all of these projects failed! So what ’s the connection between all these random failures and</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">the success we ultimately achieve d? It’s clearly not our expertise. No, it’s because of our willingness to run small experiments. That we eventually succeeded is a byproduct of the fact that we just try more things, period. That’ s what I call Creator ’s Courage . I believe everyone is born with this courage, and for those who have lost it, this book will help you rediscover the ability to come up with ideas (starting) and have the courage to try them out (asking).

I’ve found from thousands of students that limiting time to a weekend (which everyon e has) forces you to become inventive, focuses your attention only on the things that matter , and shows you how much more you can do with limitations.

Because adding up what I paid for rent, the cost of the tacos and steak and wine I liked to eat and drink, and the plane tickets that would let me work from Argentina or Korea or Thailand, all together that came to a little less than $3,000 a month. At the time, that’s what my living expenses were. Roughly speaking: $1,000 for housing, $1,000 for food and travel, $1,000 for savings and investment.

Having this ability to ask is the reason so many immigrants or children of immigrants fare well in business.

We grew to a small army of twenty people doing this consulting. Then one day my intern Kenny suggested we do a student discount card. My first thought was, well, Really? That’s because there are five cliché student business es: selling student discount cards, credit cards, T-shirts, tutoring, and something with booze. Discount cards are what business college kids often try—and fail at. Conventional wisdom said don’t bother trying, and most people would have just accepted that reality ,</p>

Really easy having a cool place when you’re loaded; not so easy, but possible, when your budget is tight. Idea: Interior designers are for rich people.

Marco, the one who I’d pegged as the leader , turned to me. “We really respect you, Noah,” he said. “But a week’ s a long time. That sounds too easy for a guy like you. How about twenty-four hours, and we get to choose your idea?” The others nodded. I had to laugh. The cojones on these people! “Fine, man.

Five minutes later, a flood of ideas came in. The three most interesting business ideas my students suggested were lemonade, salsa, and beef jerky . Now , I like lemonade. I really like salsa. But I LOVE jerky . More important, I KNOW jerky . I already was spending about $50 a month on the stuff and figured at least some of my health-conscious friends were spending that amount, too.

Is this a million-dollar opportunity? To figure that out, we have to know the number of potential customers and the price of your product.

Revenue – Cost = Profit. These determine if you can make your first million dollars.

If you’r e able to earn $12.50 in profit for every unit sold, then it’s easy to calculate how many you’ll need to sell to make $1,000,000. You just divide your target profit by the profit: Target Pr ofit $ 1,000,000 Profit per unit sold $ 12.50 Total sales needed 80,000 Okay , obviously selling 80,000 units sounds hard AF, but consider the following: This is ONL Y the number of people we see via</p>

But a few hours later in bed, around midnight, I got swamped by a wave of anxiety and thought, I’ve got only twenty-four hours! If I fail, this is going to be really embarrassing. I jumped out of bed to rerun the numbers. The One-Minute Business Model saved my ass by showing me I needed to pivot my business.

That meant: Target pr ofit $ 1,000 Profit per unit sold $ 5 Total sales needed 200 Two hundred bags of jerky in twenty-four hours?! Oof, too many sales in too little time!

Back when I was in the conference business, I started by selling individual tickets, which worked but required tons of effort. That stumped me until I thought, Oh, I can make a lot more money just selling package sponsorships to companies, who can then hand out tickets to employees or customers. That in turn got me thinking about the equivalent of sponsorships in the jerky world. How do I do bigger deals per transaction? What about</p>

If they were all three-month subscriptions, I’d need to sell only 67. And six-month? Only 33. I also realized that if I sold to offices that offered snacks, it would be easier to find customers with larger disposable budgets. Plus, I figured I had a lot of close friends at companies who could buy for their employees or refer me to their of fice managers.

The AppSumo validation worke d really well, and since I discovered the power of validating when founding AppSumo, I’ve used the Validation process for every business venture I’ve started—including Sumo Jerky . What I discover ed using the Validation process was that once you understand it, you can apply it to any and every business idea—no matter how small or trivial. Every potential business idea can be instantly verified, like your own magic wand. The benefits</p>

The Golden Rule of Validation Much like the Validation process my Monthly1K students made me use for Sumo Jerky , to validate, I turn to the Golden Rule of V alidation: Find three customers in forty-eight hours who will give you money for your idea. Success means moving quickly and spending no money . And that’ s what makes the Golden Rule of V alidation so ef fective. Here’ s why it works so well: You’re allowed only forty-eight hours.

It’s crucial to really listen and write down their problems, because you’re looking for the pain they’re feeling and how valuable it would be for them to give you money . The bigger the pain, the bigger the opportunity! Next, Options. Now that you’ve uncovered the problem, it’s time to sugg est options that can solve their problems—and what they’d pay for it. Here are some examples from Daniel: I’ll sell you a digital course on how to fix your computer</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">a lot of people say they’re interested and then not pay . No, you ask for money and ask people to pay immediately . Now a warning: When you validate, you have to get comfortab le with potentially selling a product before you’ve actually made it. Clearly explain when it will be delivered. Becau se people are fine with giving you money in advance, as long as you set clear expectations. Here’ s my favorite way to ask for money: “Sign up now while it’s still at a discounted price, x percent of y dollars [and you’ll be grandfathered in</p>

Feedback is a gift you can continually use to improve yourself and your business. Dealing with Rejection Of cours e, success won’ t always be so immediate when you use direct preselling to validate—in fact, you’ll get rejected a whole lot—and this is another instance where the technique shines.

But that’s exactl y what you want to know! 2. “Who is one person you know who would really like this?” Always, always, always ask for a referral !

The great thing about a marketplace is you have a shit-ton of people who are looking to spend money . It’s a reliable way to validate dif ferent business ideas you’re thinking of. Example: My good bud Neville wanted to validate whether people would pay to rent expensive cameras. He posted one for rent on Craigslist and</p>

                <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">

                    <p class="text-gray-600">was able to get $75 for it in a few hours. The ad Neville posted on Craigslist This simple Validation cost him $0.00 and a few minutes of time. This is SO much better versus building a website, figuring out a domain, designin g a logo, trying to find customers, etc. I also often use a simple “virtual product” process on marketplace sites to test products that don’t even exist yet! I find an item simila r to the one I want to validate, or I draw up a quick and dirty design of what I want to sell, and</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">Chunk 234</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">then I post it to the marketplace, along with a price, to see if there’ s an audience. I love playing disc golf, and once I found this really cool disc on the Reddit DIY channel. So I took the photo of the disc and just posted it on Facebook Marketplace and Twitter with a sentence saying, “Hey , Disc-Golf or Nintendo lovers. I am going to make 5 custom Nintendo discs. If you want one, paypal me $20.” The point is, I didn’ t try to find a manufacturer . I didn’ t make a website. I didn’ t</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">
                    <h2 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2 text-gray-700">Chunk 235</h2>
                    <p class="text-gray-600">try to test the disc. I just said, “Will anyone actually give me money for this?” And people did. I sold twenty of them and got an online manufacturer to make them and shipped them to customers. Another good technique involv es posting on social media where you have an audience of people. My assistant Jamie was looking to develop a side hustle, so I asked her if she had ever trained other people to be an assistant because (1) she already had the skill and was very good at it and (2) a lot of other people wanted jobs</p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="bg-white p-4 rounded-lg shadow">

                    <p class="text-gray-600">like hers. So she posted a message on Facebook right then: “Hey , I’m an assistant. I make a lot of money doing it. I want to help. If you’re curious how I do it, I’m happy to help a few other people out. Just leave a comment or message me.” Authentic, straightforward, open, and approachable. Soon enough, people started responding, and soon she was charging $100 for people to shadow her as she did her job. That is exactly how you do it! 3. Landing Pages One really popular approach is to set up a simple landing page using</p>

Find the latest landing page tools at MillionDollarW eekend.com . Then they run a bunch of ads to send people to the site and see if people actually will enter an email address to get on the mailing list, or even preorder the product. The reason I don’t love this approach is you have to spend time setting it up and buying ads, and when you buy ads, you have to become an ad expert. The whole experience is slow and costly .</p>

My recommendation for you is if you feel you have to do this, limit your work to forty-eight hours so you won’ t spend a bunch of time fruitlessly playing with your ads and landing pages or wasting money . As an example of how to do a landing page right, take what my former intern Justin Mares did while valida ting what would become the successful bone broth company Kettle & Fire. To start, he bought the domain bonebroths.com for $12 and set up a basic landing page using Unbounce. Justin paid around $5 on</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">Fiverr to come up with the simple logo. After setting up the page and writing the copy , he picked a price. He decided he could make a profit if he charged $29.99 for 16 ounces. If people were willing to give a stranger nearly $30 for a pint of a product they’d never tasted or even seen, then it was probably destined for success. At the site, peop le who hit “Ord er Now” got sent to a PayPal checkout, where they were asked to send money to Justin’ s email address for “Beef Marrow Bone Broth.” The site</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">was ugly enough to give graphic designers the cold sweats. But after Justin bought about $50 of Bing ads, people started actually coming to the site and PayPal-ing him money! Over the course of the two-week test, he netted almost $500 in revenue. And now Kettle & Fire is a $100 million company—selling broth?!?! VALIDA TED! The key is: If you go this route, don’t overthink the design, the name, the language, the ads, or any of that.

The only athlete in history to be both an NFL and an MLB all-star , he was one of the most popular athletes on the planet during the early nineties. I remember how much adoration my father felt for Bo. Coming from nothing, Bo was a shy and stuttering Alabamian who had achieved all the fame and riches imaginable, and my father came to see Bo’s success as proof of the American Dream. They also were both named Bo. Maybe it was out of a desire to pay</p>

The thing was, he had disappeared from the limelight. He wasn ’t work ing in Hollywood and he wasn’ t using an agent to keep his fame alive. He was just living a quiet life in Chicago. As I was trying to contact Bo, I learned that in 2012 he had started Bo Bikes Bama, an annual charity bike ride to raise money for emer gency disaster relief</p>

                    <p class="text-gray-600">“What’ s your unique angle in thirty seconds or less?” In other words, why would anyone care to read his newsletter? I know that sounds harsh, but that’s the first question you have to answer before you put yourself into the public sphere. Pressed into defining his unique angle, Ben paused. He rumpled his face up, laughed nervously , and shrugged. This is hard! Finally he spoke, slowly , and then with confidence. Listen to how Ben defined his angle, his sauce: “I’ve been a performance coach for the last fourteen years, working with the best athletes in the world.</p>

You can choose any FREE platform: Photographers love Instagram to showcase their newest cool stuff to the world. Consultants love to stand on a soapbox at LinkedIn.

Twitter : I love it, but the audience isn’t growing—their monthly users have been flat for years. Going viral works there, but getting people off the platform and buying on yours is tough. Nick Huber of The Sweaty Startup has turned his storage business into an even larger business mostly from tweeting provocative comments about how to run companies.</p>

YouTube is the LARGEST STREAMING VIDEO SITE ON THE INTERNET . It has 122 milli on active daily users who consume a billion hours of video each day. PLUS, YouTube monetizes your videos for you with ads and hosts them at no cost (my favorite price).

                    <p class="text-gray-600">with YouTube is that it’s harder to create a video than write a tweet, which discourag es most people. However , I see that as an advantage since it means less competition if you’re willing to do it. Or maybe you hate being on camera. But that’s no excuse , either . SO many channels have gotten massive like SunnyV2 (two plus million subscribers to his documentaries about famous people), and we’ve never seen his face.

Ali is one of the guys I respect most on YouTube and a great guide for the audience-gathering journey , so let’ s unpack his playbook for all of us to replicate! Ali uses what I call the Content Cir cle Framework . The basic idea is to start with specific topics for a tiny circle to build raving fans, then slowly expand your circle of content to influence lar ger groups of people. Here are the three steps: 1. Core Circle: Start with a very narrow audience. Ali</p>

Your niche within a niche can be the most obscure thing imagin able, as long as it makes you and your audience passionate. 2. Medium Circle: As you move bigger , your content should overlap somewhat with what concerns your Core Circle, but it should appeal to a broader audience. Ali started talking about studying and productivity in general, since that’ s required for all students. 3. Large Circle: Here you go for the largest audience possible that’s still related. Some of Ali’s most watched videos are about his salary—made</p>

All the circles should still inclu de your core audience but keep expanding your circle of influence. Here are examples of other people who followed the Content Cir cle Framework : Dustin Wunderlich of Dustin’ s Fish Tanks started by literally reviewing fish tanks. And you know what? There’ s a real audience for that. As time went on, he expanded to all thing s fish, like what kind of fish to buy to rid your tank of algae and what the top aquarium</p>

Then there’ s Kyle Lasota, the Austin-based creator behind the very cool YouTube channel kylegot camera. Kyle’ s into biohacking—he reviews cold plunges, red light therapy , saunas, sleep gadgets, supplements, and all that. While he’s got a modest audience—16,000 subscribers on YouTube—he’ s built such a tight community with his core that even though a lot of his videos get only 400 views, he nets a cool $1 million a year from af filiate sales.

Whether you have a desk job or some unique hobby , there is something about your process that others can learn from.

I was right where you are now—just starting out. And then my friend Neville Medhora started bugging me to let him write one of our emails. Neville, a copywriter , was conv inced that AppSumo’ s emails were being ignored because they were always “SELLING SELLING SELLING.” Entrepreneurs who expressed an attractive story made more sales, he said.

Still, I figured I had nothing to lose from giving him a chance, so I let Neville draft the email for our next offer—an app called Kernest that helped with fonts, a subject I know nothing about. Normally , Nikola would have just written: “There’ s a deal on this product and you get to save $1,000!” Throw in a buy button and that was my typical email. It was just “Go buy!”—not much more than that. An hour later Neville sent me a rough draft of an email, and what</p>

It takes an obsessive eye to pick which fonts play well together , and every month a new combination of fonts is delivered to you . . . complete with HTML and CSS highlighting.

I have 120,000 Twitter followers, 750,000 YouTube subscribers, and 150,000 TikTok fans—and I would give them all up for my 100,000 email subscribers. Why? Every time I send an email, 40,000 people open it and consume my content. I’m not hoping the platform gods will allow me to reach them. On the other platforms, anywhere between 100 and 1 million people pay attention to my content, but it’s not consis tent or in my control. 3.

Recently , my main goal was to grow my YouTube.com/okdork channel to 500,000 subscribers (number) within one year (time frame). So I set out a monthly schedule, keeping in mind that I’d probably want to start slow and then accelerate as I test my different tactics and double down on the ones that work. Here’ s how I’ve modeled my goal of 500,000 subscribers: This spreadsheet gives me tangible monthly tar gets. July’ s goal</p>

Knowing the numbers is an extremely helpful way to stay focused on one objective. I can say no to a lot of ideas that might be fun to try but don’ t bring results. You’ve got a timeline. Great. What’ s next? 2. Create your Marketing Experiment List. “I’m tweeting twice a day and it’s going to help me sell my new course to Realtors,” said one of my students.

Fast-forward. Many days later , I asked Ricky how many sales he had made. $0. “I say this in a judgment-free way, BUT have you tried any other marketing ideas to help sell to Realtors?” He had not.

Let me give you a real-world example: the story of Daniel Bliss. Daniel is a hobbyist climber , a Canadian, a great guy—and the winner of the AppSumo Make a $1,000 a Month Business getaway to Austin , where we personally worked together for a week on his business. Our goal for his getaway was to turn his climbing hobby into a real business, making $4,000 a month. Getting to his Freedom Number would allow him</p>

Daniel was smartly focused on solving one of his own problems. He’s a rock climber , and it hurt his neck to lean back and look up while he was belaying (standing on the ground helping the climber above him). He wanted to buy glasses to let him look up without craning his neck. He had already found a manufa cturer on Alibaba to make the glasses he wanted, with mirrors that let you</p>

He sold two pairs to a couple he met while climbing and the rest to his climbing group. But now he was stuck. How do you grow beyond that? Like most entrepreneurs, Daniel did the obvious yet wrong things. He wasted time tricking out his Shopify website with bells and whistles . He investigated intellectual property laws to protect his design. He stalked competitors. Let’s fix that . . . First, we worked backwards from his</p>

Here are the questions I use to prioritize my time: 1. How do I pick what to actually do each week? Every Sunday , I spend fifteen minutes looking over the past week and setting my tasks for the next one. This is your chance to revisi t your yearly goals and choose activities each week to move you closer toward your goals. 2. How do</p>

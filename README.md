# Book2SocialFeed 📚➡️📱

Still under development 🚧

This Python script extracts text from PDF files, splits it into chunks, and saves the chunks as a JSON array. It's perfect for processing documents and preparing text data for further usage, such as creating social media content from books.

## Roadmap 🛣️

- [ ] Add a web interface to the script.
- [ ] Accept input file from frontend UI.
- [ ] Update to use OpenAI's GPT or its equivalent to create more intelligent chunks and social media-friendly content.
